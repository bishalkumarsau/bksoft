          <p>            What a great year we've had planning for the future of AJP. It's all about the music as we like to say. Our mission continues to receive support in a variety of forms. We set out to spread the word and build our following so we can continue for years to come. We have secured two new AJP Partners for 2013: The City of Roswell Cultural Arts and Chukkar Farm Event Facility. Our Inaugural Event for &quot;Roswell Presents Friday Night Live&quot; will feature The Freddy Cole Quartet in the beautiful 600 seat Roswell Cultural Arts Theater, Friday February 15th. Beginning May 17th we will kick off a &quot;Jazz Beneath the Stars&quot; series at the beautiful outdoor venue of Chukkar Farm in Alpharetta. Both of these venues are quite special and we are proud to have been chosen to produce future events. <br />
            <br />
            As many of you know there were no less than a dozen Jazz events that folded in the past 18 months! In order for us to continue our mission we need your help, financial assistance, and our directors have voted unanimously to adopt a sponsorship program outlined in our website. How would you like the opportunity to sponsor Bucky Pizzarelli or Freddy Cole or Ken Peplowski or any artist and be proudly recognized during the weeks leading up to and during the weekend long event? Perhaps you wish to just make a donation, sponsorship of the Piano or after hours social? We hope you will help us keep our dream alive to promote, produce and preserve one of the greatest arts our great country has given the world! <br />
